<h1 class="font-lato">We know you don't like paying for features.</h1>
<h2 class="font-lato">That's why there are no paid ones. <u>Forever.</u></h2>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="font-lato">Moderate with ease.</h3>
BitPizza has some cool commands that allow you to moderate the server faster and better.

<br>
<br>

<h3 class="font-lato">Haha funny lol</h3>
Our bot also comes with fun commands, that allow you to browse memes on Discord. We also added cat and dog images commands but that's another topic.

<br>
<br>

<h3>No paying for features.</h3>
As we said in the title, we will never require you to pay for additional features. We want to be as transparent as we can, so here's the catch - we are powered by donations. Of course, when you donate you get nothing, but you support the development of BitPizza.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Any problems or maybe you want to suggest new commands?</h3>
Join our official Discord server - we will try to help. Or maybe you just want to chat with other people on the server.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Scheduled messages and Embed Creator.</h3>
You want BitPizza to ping <bold style="color:#7289DA">@everyone</bold> at 1 AM? Sure, go ahead. But make sure people in the server won't be mad at you for scheduling that. And also we have Embed Creator - create cool embeds with commands.
